# Hello, world!

This is my first post! In this blog I eventually focus on the following
topics:

* Programming: Node.js and Go are the things I do currently
* Data science and visualization: in R
* Automation and infrastructure stuff

Until my next post, you can check out my Github projects
[here](https://github.com/teekaay).
